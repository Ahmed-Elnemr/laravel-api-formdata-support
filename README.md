# Laravel API Form Data Support

This package provides seamless handling of **form data** in Laravel APIs, especially for `PUT` and `PATCH` requests.
It automatically parses incoming requests containing **multipart form data** and makes both form inputs and uploaded files easily accessible.

## 🚀 Installation

You can install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require ahmed-elnemr/laravel-api-formdata-support

## ⚡ Usage

Once installed, the package automatically integrates into your Laravel application.
You can now send `multipart/form-data` requests (including `PUT` and `PATCH`), and Laravel will correctly parse inputs and file uploads without extra configuration.
